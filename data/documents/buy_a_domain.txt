# Buy a Domain

## Purchase a domain
Tucows does not sell directly to customers, as we operate under a wholesale model. You can buy a domain through one of our affiliated Domain Providers, or our in-house provider, Hover at http://www.hover.com/

## Purchase a domain that is already registered with Tucows
You'll want to contact the owner directly. A Whois search at https://tucowsdomains.com/whois-search/ can provide this information.

If the results of a Whois search do not provide the owner's contact details, you can submit a request to contact the owner at https://contactprivacy.com/

If the owner wishes to sell the domain, the sale and transfer will most likely be handled by their Domain Provider at https://tucowsdomains.com/provider-search/

## Domain Names Explained
Domain names are a fundamental part of Internet infrastructure that enable us to easily access websites, email servers, and other content. Without domain names, to access a website, you'd have to memorize the IP address where it lives (can you imagine?). With domain names, you just get to type in a memorable string of characters (much easier).

For example, our primary domain name, tucows.com, directs you to our corporate website and is used for all of our employee email addresses—which all end in "@tucows.com." The company you work for probably has a similar setup.

In short—domain names point to where websites live.
